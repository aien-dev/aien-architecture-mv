# Architecture Decision Records

Resolved architectural decisions are recorded here so implementation agents do not repeatedly reopen settled boundaries.

## Naming ADRs across repositories

`aien-architecture` and `aien-dev/aienux` number their ADRs independently, so the same number (for example 0012 or 0016) names two different decisions. In prose (docs, plans, issues, PRs, commit messages), cite an ADR with its repository prefix:

- `ARCH-00nn`: an ADR in this repository (`aien-architecture/docs/adr/`), e.g. ARCH-0016 is the resident reaction architecture.
- `OS-00nn`: an ADR in `aien-dev/aienux` (`docs/adr/`), e.g. OS-0012 is self-construction, capability growth and generations.

A bare "ADR 00nn" is acceptable only inside the repository that owns it. Files are not renamed: the prefix is a citation convention, and existing file names and historical references stay as they are.

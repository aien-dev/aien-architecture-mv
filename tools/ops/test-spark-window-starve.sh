# test-spark-window-starve.sh [SCRIPT]: regression test for spark-window _hold.
# Uses only temp lock files and a temp window root; never touches /tmp/aien-quiet.lock
# or /tmp/aien-gb10.lock.
#   case 1 (no contention): opens fast.
#   case 2 (one shared holder, plain flock -s, no pause): opens within LIMIT seconds.
#     One holder still leaves a gap, which is the L189 path.
#   case 3 (two shared holders through $SPARK_QUIET_GATE, no pause): opens within LIMIT.
#     Same order as quiet-build, so the gate at spark-window L322 keeps new holders out
#     and the drain finishes. This is the case the default run treats as deterministic.
#   case 4 (chip busy): waits for the chip, then opens.
#   case 5 (two plain flock -s holders, no gate): known-starvable. Linux flock gives an
#     exclusive waiter no priority, so two holders with no gap can starve the window.
#     Skipped unless SPARK_STARVE_PLAIN=1.
# Exit 0 = every case that ran passed (a skip is not a failure). Pass an older script path to see it fail (red).
